## Project Description
The goal of this project is to predict which mushrooms are poisonous and which are edible based on their physical characteristics. The dataset used in this project is from the Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms, which contains descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom (1981).

### Technologies
- Machine Learning
- Python
- Google Colab Notebooks

### Problem Statement
The main goal is to predict which mushroom is poisonous and which is edible based on given features.
